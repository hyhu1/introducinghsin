<h1>Hsin Yi Hu</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Hsin Yi Hu and I am a fourth year cognitive science major at UCI! In my freetime, I like to go out and hang out with my friends. One fun fact about me is that I was born in Taiwan. </p>

<h3>My Favorite Things!</h3>
<p>My favorite color is <span style="color: blue">blue</span>! My favorite flowers are roses! My favorite song right now is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1zITtyOg44" target="_blank">Wish It was You by Audien</a>. My favorite drink right now is the yogurt green tea from <a href="https://www.snrtea.com/menu" target="_blank">Sunright</a>. My favorite TV show is "How I Met Your Mother".

<h3>Why Cognitive Science?</h3>
<p>In the beginning of my college career, I was set on being pre-med. However, after actually getting a job at a OBGYN clinic as a medical assistant, I realized that this was not the life I wanted to live. I began to search for things that were of interest to me and I landed on coding. After reading through some options, I decided that since a lot of my old pre-med classes lined up with the cognitive science track, I decided to switch my major. Since then, I have been geniunely engaged in my classes and I have been a lot happier. </p>

<h3>What I hope to do in the future.</h3>
<p>Although I am not completely sure what I want to do in the future yet, I am sure that I want to do something in the tech field. I think right now, I am debating between something in med-tech or something like a project manager. I am a little anxious about my future at the moment though, because the economy is not doing so well and not a lot of people are getting hired. I also fear that because I am not a computer science major, I may lack in a lot of things as compared to my peers</p>
